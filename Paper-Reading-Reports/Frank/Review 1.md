## TROLLMAGNIFIER Detecting State-Sponsored Troll Accounts on Reddit
Summary: 
It has become more and more common for political campaigns to attempt to influence public opinion on key topics by using bot accounts on different social media to generate discussion and spread awareness about certain issues. TROLLMAGNIFIER is a detection system for these accounts, looking to make it easier for social media accounts to identify and deal with these bots. 

Main takeaways:
  * Troll accounts create disinformation campaigns by posting fake or biased original content, simulating conversaions with each other, and polarizing on-going conversations. 
  * TROLLMAGNIFIER was trained using known Russian-Sponsored troll accounts on Reddit, noting features such as total comments, total submissions, account age, Fraction of submissions with the same title as troll accounts, Fraction of comments on submissions that troll accounts commented etc.
  * Four Classifiers were considered for the initial identifier of troll accounts: K-nearest Neighbors, Linear SVM, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, with Random Forest providing the pest precision and accuracy
  * Despite being initially trained on Russian propaganda, TROLLMAGNIFIER was tested on content relating to an UAE-sponsored influence campaign with good results. 

Strengths:
The paper demonstrates a program that is able to successfully identify misinformation campaigns on Reddit with a high rate of accuracy. It also conducts a thorough analysis on the troll accounts, looking into the specific wordings of the posts, common themes, and even correlations in post times, or account creations, using all of the data cohesively to analyse trolls. 

Weaknesses:
While the program is successful with the data given, the authors concede many of its potential flaws without providing possible solutions. They acknowledge that with some basic understanding of its inner workings, troll accounts could be trained to evade TROLLMAGNIFIER, it requires a training set of posts, meaning that it will only identify misinformation campaigns moderators are already aware of, and its weakness identifying trolls through images. With so many weaknesses and no proposed solutions so far, this program doesn't feel as viable for investment. Furthermore, there is no strong evidence presented in the paper that the same principles could be applied on other social media platforms, such as Facebook.
