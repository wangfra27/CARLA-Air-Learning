## 27 Years and 81 Million Opportunities Later Investigating the Use of Email Encryption for an Entire University
Summary: 
Email is one of the most widely used forms of communication used on the internet. It differs from other forms of communication in that end-to-end encryption is not implemented by default and requires the users to implement it themselves through a somewhat lengthy process. This paper explores email encryption and examines how common the use of encryption is at a Large German University. The authors found that while around 3% of emails were signed using PGP or S/MIME, only 0.06% were actually encrypted. It was also found that insecure or outdated keys accounted for a significant amount of the PGP keys. 

Main takeaways:
  * Very few casual users of email feel the need to encrypt their data.
  * The majority of users that do use PGP or S/MIME do not use it for security purposes; they use it because it came bundled with something else. 
  * Users often do setup their keys well originally, but fail to keep it updated.
 
Strengths:
  * The Methodology returned good results about the use of email encryption with precise statistics and a deep analysis of the meaning behind the results. They also delve deeper in a lot of subjects analyzing deeper than originally outlined, or would be necessary (eg. when they looked into the use of insecure keys). 
Weaknesses: 
  * The study does acknowledge that there was an inconsistancy in their results with original works where S/MIME was used more into PGP, but does not look into the cause of this or the impacts. 
  * This study does not present any clear solutions to the problem other than suggesting that the University more aggressively impress onto its members that encryption is important. 
  * The study provides information on a very specific dataset-University attendees in Germany, not considering how this data might change when used by people in a different setting, or people who are transmitting more sensitive data on a regular basis.
