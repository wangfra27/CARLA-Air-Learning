key points:

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is vulnerable to backdoor attacks (produce unexpected output)
2 State of the art trigger embedding methods for backdoor
 -Homograph Replacement: embed trigger into deep neural network through visual spoofing of lookalike character replacement
 -Dynamic Sentence Attack: subtle difference between text generated by language models and real natural text to produce trigger sentences with correct grammar and high fluency
Shown to be quite effective at producing unexpected behavior
Focused on three categories of NLP-
 -toxic comment processing
 -neural machine translation
 - question answering
States that most other papers fail to talk about anything other than than the "text classification" task
****Backdoor techniques presented in this paper interact directly with humans
****Carefully designed answers given to humans to input can illicit potentially toxic or malicious responses

review:

strengths-
Ample graphs and visual data
Very detailed
Explains why this paper is different than other papers
Explained well, diction and grammar is satisfactory. There were some sentences that felt somewhat akward but they were sparse.

weaknesses-
Introduction is unnecessarily long and drags on. Could be more concise.
