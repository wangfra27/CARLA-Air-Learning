key points:
Proposed to generate adverserial patterns to be applied on vehicle surface so it is not recognizable by detectors in Carla
Two types of attacks: digital (modifying input) and physical (ex. sticking a stop sign over a stop sign so a car can't recognize it)
Previous studies vary in key factors: attack entry point/object, targeted task/model
Tackle this by manipulating vehicle texture-
 -enlarge and repeat method and discrete search attacking method
 -found it easy to pose a non-negligible threat
 -noticed that the clean cases showed better attacking results
