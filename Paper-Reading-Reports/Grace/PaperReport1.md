## The Effect of Google Search on Software Security: Unobtrusive Security Interventions via Content Re-ranking
Summary: 
Insecure code (in the context of cyberscecurity) is more highly ranked in Google Search results in comparison to secure code, which leads to a greater use of insecure code in applications or software development, therefore posing a risk of higher security breaches. 

Main takeaways:
  * Sharing, reusing, and altering existing code is necessary to improve software development, however in turn it may lead to increased security risk.
  * Online resources such as Stack Overflow are extremely popular among developers, but are often prone to insecure solutions.
 
Strengths:
  * Methodology was simple, clear, yet effective. The data gathered from Google Search results compared to the reranking results overwhelmingly supported their ideas. 
Weaknesses: 
  * Study does not consider the use of non-online resources.
