# What he said:
* He talked about some company in Germany and how they used a UAV and a car in tandem to make very effective training.

# Takeways + Possible Experiment
* Maybe work on implementing a custom environment similar to Carla and training a model to recognize objects from bird eyeview. If we could somehow compare this to what the car in Carla is getting as input and outputting we could gain a more effective training paradigm. This would take time to implement but we could write about this in a paper (comparing just a car learning vs a car learning with the assistance of a UAV)
