Progress Report 3 (6/12)
Accomplishments: 
Completely finished downloading papers, organized all the papers within the folders
Finished presentation on Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient
Ongoing: 
Compiling Carla on Linux servers in lab
Problems: 
While compiling URE4 on the Linux computer, we completely ran out of disk space and the VM paused. We will have to partition more space to the VM, though we have 
concerns about disk usage on the computer.
Next Steps: 
Need to connect OpenPilot to Carla through the existing bridge
