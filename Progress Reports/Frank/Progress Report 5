# Progress Report 5
## Accomplishments
  * Got a fully working model of Carla on the server
  * Completely installed the Px4 autopilot on the server
  * Installed Gazebo simulator on the server to run along side Px4 autopilot
  * Setup the joystick to control the drone on the Px4
  * Began Reinforcement Learning algorithm on Carla
  * Began an attempt to pull as much data from one run of Carla using as many sensors as possible to test the upper limits of the simulator and gain an understanding of Carla's Python API
  
## Ongoing
  * The Reinforcement Learning Algorithm I was following online is outdated and uses an old version of Tensorflow. I have been updating the code accordingly-still in progress
  * There are more sensors that we have access to on Carla that we haven't written code for yet
  
  #Problems
  * The Carla server runs very slowly with an FPS of around 3. It is possible that we will be able to pull data faster from Carla once this problem is figured out
  *
