# Takeaways from Sunday Meeting with Dr. Li
 * A deeper understanding of any program is fundemental for future analysis
 * We can learn a lot more if the entire process is analyzed from end to end, working on our own data collection and training so that we can better understand the results

# Future goals
 * Train a more complex agent using a larger amount of trajectories
 * Take apart a trajectory to analyze how it was created, consider making and using my own trajectories
 * Test the agent under different weather conditions and with different vehicles to see if it can adapt
