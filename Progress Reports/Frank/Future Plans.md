# Future Plans
 * Delve deeper into LAV and look for ways to exploit/improve on it after a end-to-end evaluation. 
 * Look for ways to use the LAV algorithm, possibly by connecting it to previous goals, such as connecting it to Airsim/Stable Baselines
 * Try to connect LAV to hardware through the PX4
 * Write paper analyzing and comparing the different simulators and the capacity of their self-driving algorithms.
