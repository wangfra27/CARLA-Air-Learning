# Work in Progress
 * Began an analysis of [Adversarial Attack injection in Carla](https://github.com/piazzesiNiccolo/myLbc).
      * Running the adversarial attacks has some slight complications with the computer's installed CUDA. I am not sure exactly what the problem is, but it is some kind of CUDA compatibility issue. Earlier this summer, we already updated the CUDA on the computer, so I am unsure how to continue diagnosing the issue. 
 * Began examining the output of the trainers from LAV. 
      * They generate a .th file which was created as a way to visualize 3d caves. 
      * I have installed xTherion as a way to open and read the files, but haven't finished going through xTherion's documentation and don't know how to open the .th files. It seems there is a .thconfig file needed that I have not been able to find.  

# Future goals
 * Finish the analysis of the attacks by examining what each attack is specifically
 * Figure out the capabilities of xTherion and the .th files
 * Solve the CUDA issue, may need some help.
