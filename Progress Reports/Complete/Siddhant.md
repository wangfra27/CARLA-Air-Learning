# Accomplishments
* Read attached papers related to Air Learning and Carla
* took [notes](https://github.com/wangfra27/HIL-Computer-Simulation-of-Intelligent-Cybersecurity/blob/main/Paper-Reading-Reports/Siddhant/%231%20Physical%20Adversarial%20Attack%20on%20Vehicle%20Detector%20in%20the%20Carla%20Simulator) on a paper: ["Physical Adversarial Attack on Vehicle Detector in the Carla Simulator"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.16118.pdf)
* Installed Prerequisites/Dependencies for Carla
* Installed modified fork of Unreal Engine
* Built Unreal Engine
* Cloned Carla Repository
* Downloaded and extracted Carla assets
* Organized Github repository
* Added folders for research paper related things
* Succesfully built server
* Successfully installed Carla without error on my computer. Doesn't yet work since I don't have the proper specs to run it but there were no errors, the process just killed itself.
* Wrote a [review](https://github.com/wangfra27/HIL-Computer-Simulation-of-Intelligent-Cybersecurity/blob/main/Paper-Reading-Reports/Siddhant/%233_Get_A_Model!_Model_Hijacking_Attack_Against_Machine_Learning_Models.md) of the paper ["Get a Model! Model Hijacking Attack Against Machine Learning Models"](https://github.com/wangfra27/HIL-Computer-Simulation-of-Intelligent-Cybersecurity/blob/main/Summer%20Research%202022/Conference%20Papers/NDSS_2022/Get%20a%20Model!%20Model%20Hijacking%20Attack%20Against%20Machine%20Learning%20Models.pdf)
* Successfully installed Gym on both my personal computer and the computer in the lab
* Successfully ran a program on Gym on both my personal computer and the computer in the lab
* Got 1 reinforcement learning algorithm running successfully using Gym on the computer in the lab. It is a simple Q Learning algorithm (not deep learning). Does not use Stable Baselines.
* Finished [review](https://github.com/wangfra27/HIL-Computer-Simulation-of-Intelligent-Cybersecurity/blob/main/Paper-Reading-Reports/Siddhant/%232%20Hidden%20Backdoors%20in%20Human-Centric%20Language%20Models) of paper: ["Hidden Backdoors in Human-Centric Language Models"](https://github.com/wangfra27/HIL-Computer-Simulation-of-Intelligent-Cybersecurity/blob/main/Summer%20Research%202022/Conference%20Papers/ACM_CCS_2021/Hidden%20Backdoors%20in%20Human-Centric%20Language%20Models.pdf)
* Finished Presentation on the A2C algorithm, a variant of the Advantage Actor Critic algorithm.
*  Read "Get a Model! Model Hijacking Attack Against Machine Learning Models" and wrote review
* Got NES Mario running with a PPO algorithm (I did not use retro as I had trouble installing, instead I followed [this](https://pypi.org/project/gym-super-mario-bros/))
* Succesfully installed AirSim and built it
* Succesfully ran a simulation where I controlled a car through keyboard input within the Blocks environment

* Succesfully implemented a DQN algorithm within the car simulation in the Blocks environment

* Finished [report](https://github.com/wangfra27/HIL-Computer-Simulation-of-Intelligent-Cybersecurity/blob/main/Paper-Reading-Reports/Siddhant/%234_Back_to_the_Drawing_Board:_A_Critical_Evaluation_of_Poisoning_Attacks_on_Production_Federated_Learning.md) on [Back to the Drawing Board: A Critical Evaluation of Poisoning Attacks on Production Federated Learning](https://github.com/wangfra27/HIL-Computer-Simulation-of-Intelligent-Cybersecurity/blob/main/Summer%20Research%202022/Conference%20Papers/IEEE%202022/Back%20to%20the%20Drawing%20Board%20A%20Critical%20Evaluation%20of%20Poisoning%20Attacks%20on%20Federated%20Learning%20.pdf)
* Helped install Carla and Airsim
* Managed to get Carla to succesfully spawn in a set amount of vehicles and pedestrians
* Managed to set custom weather
* Detailed notes [here](https://github.com/wangfra27/HIL-Computer-Simulation-of-Intelligent-Cybersecurity/blob/main/Notes/Siddhant-06-24-22.md)
* Did research into different simulators: Sim4CV and Flightmare. I created a [document](https://github.com/wangfra27/HIL-Computer-Simulation-of-Intelligent-Cybersecurity/blob/main/Progress%20Reports/Siddhant/ProgressReport6.md) that goes into the pros and cons of each and why I think Flightmare is the better choice. Also talked about problems with Openpilot.
* Successfully set up Openpilot
* Succesfully set up a server for running Flightmare simulations, it runs perfectly on the main desktop
* Replicated Bala's setup: build Unreal Engine 4.27, installed Airsim, and ran a simulation
* succesfully installed Flightmare
* succesfully ran a couple demos using ros
* created Dr. Li proposal
* have a demo that answers some criticisms
```
roslaunch flightros racing.launch
```
* Wrote detailed [documentation](https://github.com/wangfra27/HIL-Computer-Simulation-of-Intelligent-Cybersecurity/blob/main/Notes/FlightmareInstallation.md) on the installation of Flightmare
* Wrote [comments for racing.cpp](https://github.com/wangfra27/HIL-Computer-Simulation-of-Intelligent-Cybersecurity/blob/main/Notes/racing.cpp) and pushed the code with the comments to Github
