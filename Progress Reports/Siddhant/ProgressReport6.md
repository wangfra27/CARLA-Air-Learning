# Openpilot
Doing some research online, I found two methods online to install Openpilot. One was a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfDLKVRycRA) which used a ubuntu setup script that does not work for Ubuntu 18.04 (which we are currently using). The other computer does not have a Nvidia graphics card so using the other computer is not an option at the moment. As for the [other method](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/blob/master/tools/sim/README.md) which used a [bridge](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/blob/master/tools/sim/bridge.py) script that did not work. I would continue working on this but another issue is that Openpilot is not photorealistic. Additionally, I could not find any way to implement outside deep learning algorithms (e.g., stable baselines) through OpenPilot.
