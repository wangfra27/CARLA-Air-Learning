Accomplishments:
Successfully installed Carla without error on my computer. Doesn't yet work since I don't have the proper specs to run it but there were no errors, the process just killed itself.
Successfully installed Gym on both my personal computer and the computer in the lab
Successfully ran a program on Gym on both my personal computer and the computer in the lab
Got 1 reinforcement learning algorithm running successfully using Gym on the computer in the lab.
Finished review of paper: "Hidden Backdoors in Human-Centric Language Models"

Ongoing:
Installation of Carla on the computer in the lab
Researching Reinforcement Learning
Trying to run more Reinforcement Learning Algorithms using Gym

Problems:
Installation of Carla was halted as there was not enough disk space on the computer. We used the exact same process as the one that worked for me.

Next step:
Figure out a way to get more disk space and finish the installation of Carla
Get more algorithms running in Gym
Do more research and maybe read a "reinforcement learning" related paper for this week
