Problems:
Problem building Carla. Attempted to compile the PythonAPI client but got errors. Seems to be a Cmake error. Tried a couple solutions online
to no avail. Currently stuck at the building Carla phase.

Next Step:
Work on figuring out why the error is happening and solving it. Maybe try reinstalling Cmake. Try some more solutions online. Work on successfully building Carla so
we can move on with running OpenPilot in Carla.
