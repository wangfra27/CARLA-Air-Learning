# Accomplishments
* succesfully installed Flightmare
* succesfully ran a couple demos using ros
* created Dr. Li proposal
* have a demo that answers some criticisms
```
roslaunch flightros racing.launch
```

# Problems
* problems with getting the forest environment to work
* I have little to no C++ knowledge so progress is a bit slow
* in order to implement stable baselines we need to use python but then we can't set the environment using python, am working on finding a solution to this problem


# Ongoing
* am working on creating some more custom scripts since right now i am merely cloning examples and editing them
* working on getting a [flightmare_px4](https://github.com/gipsa-lab-uav/flightmare_px4) ros package to work.

# Next Steps
* If I manage to finish setting that up start getting some data so we can start outlining a paper
