# Progress Report 6
## Accomplishments
  * Succesfully replicated Vista demos on OU desktop
  * Used a pure pursuit controller as a path tracker to control an autonomous vehicle.

Although the two car agents were created under the same conditions, the sensory output has different measurements at one timestep. However, this difference is indiscernible to the eye.

## Issues
  * Some parts of Vista are unreleased, making it difficult to completely use its full potential. For example, there are some missing directories and conversion scripts for larger datasets are unavailable. 

## In-progress/Future Goals
  * Training an agent using imitation learning. There is no output for some reason. 
  * I downloaded KITTI dataset and am attempting to find if it is possible to convert into Vista-compatible files.
